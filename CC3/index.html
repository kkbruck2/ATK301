  <h2> History</h2>
  <p> I am from Sibley, IL, and I have spent that last 20 years working in <br>
    HigherEducation textbook publishing as an illustrator and art <br>
    development editor. With the move to digital learning, I am considered <br>
    out of date. I loved my job and working in the education field. </p>
<hr>
  <h2> Goals</h2>
  <p>After graduating, I would like to resume working in education development<br>
    arts.I wouldn't mind returning to higher education, but I am now more passionate<br>
    about k-12 education. I have twin sons with one on the spectrum and the other<br>
    ADD. As a parent, I was able to observe k-12 education and witness a reluctance to<br>
    use new technology to accommodate unique learners.</p>
<hr>
  <h2> Dreams</h2>
  <p> My ideal goal is to use my artistic and development experience to push the <br>
    quality and standards of learning applications. The gaming industry has proven<br>
    that the technology is there. I want to develop learning apps that can excite <br>
    enthusiasm, but maintain efficiency to accommodate many devices and streaming speeds.</p>
