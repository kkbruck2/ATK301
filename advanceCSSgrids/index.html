        <p class="bold">This is my son Eli when he was 4. He loves movies. One of
          his favorites was Star Wars. He is acting out the part of Darth Vader in this scene.
          He is watching himself in the window.</p>
        <p class="bold">Some parent might wander why my 4-year old was watching
          Star Wars. To understand, they would have to understand Eli and his friend Zach.
          Eli and Zach are on the spectrum and movies were a way to understand emotional
          environments in a non-threatening place. Movies also helped Eli to talk. He would
          use what he heard in the context of daily living. He learned the concept of a dog and how
          to desribe a dog from Lilo and Stich.</p>
          <p class="bold">This video is precious because Eli was expressing himself, and as an adult,
          he is going to college in broadcasting and is involved in Autism awareness activities.</p>
