  <h1>ATK301 Assignment 4</h1>

  MyI am from Sibley, IL and I have spent that last 20 years working in Higher
  Education textbook illustration and development. Due to the transition into
  digital text, I, with several of my peers were laid off in 2016 . I loved my
  job and working in the education field. It was great to get paid for learning.
  After graduating, I would like to resume working in education development arts.
  I wouldn't mind returning to higher education, but I am now more passionate
  about k-12 education. I have twin sons and as a parent, I was able to observe
  k-12 education and witness a reluctance to use new technology. Recently,
  I have substituted for k-12 at my sons' former school. Isaac and Eli will be
  21 so some time has elapsed since they attended elementary school. As a
  substitute, I noticed more technology being introduced and is becoming more
  important in the classroom. Another school I worked at was able to supply
  chrome-books for every student. Schools in this area provide tablets and
  computer resources for students to access.

  My future goal is to use my artistic and development experience to push the
  quality and standards of learning applications. The gaming industry has proven
  that the technology is there. I want to develop learning apps that can excite
  enthusiasm, but maintain efficiency to accommodate many devices
  and streaming speeds.
