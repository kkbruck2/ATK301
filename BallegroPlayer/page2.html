    <h3>There are a couple of steps to promote an app</h3>

    <ul class="steps">
      <li>Find a niche market and focus your design choices to that audience.</li>
      <li>Find a design mentor who will support your exploration and give critical feedback.</li>
      <li>Test the app experience with participants to ensure that the experience you expect is the experience had by audiences.</li>
      <li>Target your audience to ask for specific needs they have.</li>
      <li>When your app is complete and tested properly, deploy it in accessible marketplaces.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h4 class="faq">When should I ask my target audience for their preferred features?</h3>
    <p> Ask multiple times in the process, starting with the beginning of the project.
      Your audience might have different needs or restrictions that you have not thought of.</p>
    <h4 class="faq">Can I create a few wireframes and have someone turn it into an app for me?</h3>
    <p>No. You will need to conceive of the usable design, the backend coding
      and account for the whole user <em>experience</em> yourself or as a team.</p>
    <h4 class="faq">Can I spend a couple of minutes with a customer and have it count as design critique?</h3>
    <p>No, you need to fully understand the user's context for using the app
      to ensure it is most effective. Plan to spend at least an hour with them using the app.</p>
    <h4 class="faq">What do I do when I have released a beta version of my app?</h3>
    <p>Be ready to address system bugs as they occur from your users.</p>
