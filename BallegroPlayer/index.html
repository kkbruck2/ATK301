  <h1> WHAT</h1>

  <h3> VIRTUAL DANCE ACCOMPANIST <i>(working title)</i></h3>
  <img src="images/intern1.jpg" alt="Acclaimed collaborative pianist Yawen">
  <p> is expected to be a game-changing Online Interactive Dance Music Library/Player/App
    that can move the needles for the dance educators for their dance class teaching.
    An acclaimed collaborative pianist with nearly 2 decades of experience
    working with dancers and dance teachers.</p>
  <p>Yawen is the producer of this project and is looking for a technical collaborator who can help build the web portion of
    the library: mobile site, (app), website, and certain plugins.</p>
  <p>The music content will include primarily Yawen’s recorded tracks as well as submissions from other pianist.

  <h1> WHY </h1>


  <p>After having been working in the dance industry for nearly two decades and
    conversing with the dance teachers, I see that Music is an essential part of
     dancer’s training. Simply put, good and appropriate music selection and
     performance is like the best dance partner - it helps the students dance
     better and make progress faster. Yet not all the studios have the budget
     to use live pianist which is always preferred over recorded music by the
    teachers and the students (well, although not all the live pianist can
    provide satisfying music selection and performance!). Live music brings
    into the classroom a physical energy that is irreplaceable by the recorded music,
    a good dance musician is like a fast-reacting and self-updated playlist, and…
    AND, he/she is able to play the music at the tempo that is most conducive for
    the training process. While most dance studios struggle to find the budget to
    hire live pianists/musicians (and by the way, the industry’s low pay rate
    for a dance accompanist is ridiculously embarrassing. It is a very specialized
    skill yet it pays almost nothing), they have to use CDs and recordings as a replacement.
    For as long as I have worked in the industry, I have heard constant whining
    from the teachers about how the inflexible tempo have been driving them crazy.
    Some studios have the “ Karaoke Player” connected to their CD Player that can do
    some tempo/pitch shifting, and there are a few apps and plugins already
    existing in the marketplace that provide the tempo modification feature. However,
    accordingly to my research, these apps require many steps thus a lengthy
    process to get the desired result. For example, the user first has to import
    their own playlist(s) intothe app before anything can happen. The playlists
    don’t update themselves. So for the teacher,it can be a frustrating process
    to always have to hunt for the music, build their own playlists,and import
    them into the app. People are eager and impatient for a solution: an integrated
    place where they can find all the best and suitable music in seconds, then
    modify the tempo on the fly! I’m aspired and inspired to build such a new
    invention that can change the game for the dance education.

  <p>Check the internet for great music apps in all areas of the world, or look
    for options right here at ISU. Notice how few apps there are to accompany
    dancers with music. Consider how this app would be useful to you!
